**Log a process-listing failure during the grace period.**

If a later `ps` call fails or prints nothing, this branch skips SIGKILL without a diagnostic. The initial listing failure is logged, and the stated removal contract also calls for logging failed listings. Log `why` before returning.

Review comment at @crates/process/src/worktree/stray.rs around lines 53 - 55:
Update the `running_from` failure branch to log `why` before returning, so a
failed or empty process listing during the grace period produces a diagnostic
and still skips SIGKILL.

After applying the fix, consider running `coderabbit review --agent` for local
review. Visit https://docs.coderabbit.ai/cli?utm_source=ghpr
